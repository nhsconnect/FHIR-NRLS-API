## Case Studies

Case studies provide examples of how real world problems have been solved using FHIR&reg; API's. Following a process that shows how the project evolved from gathering business requirements through to the final creation of a solution, case studies offer insight and education from the experience of other trusts and service providers.

Case studies demonstrate the application of the [Engagement Process](/engage).The outline of this process can be seen in the following diagram.

The development of FHIR&reg; based API's relies on community engagement.
