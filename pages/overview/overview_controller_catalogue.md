summary: An overview of data controllers using the NRL service.
---

The purpose of the controller catalogue is to document the health and social care organisations authorised to share records using the National Record Locator (NRL) service.

Any requests to share information via NHS Digital services, the source and consumer of that information, are reviewed by the Interoperability Working Group (IWG) and a recommendation provided by the group as to the appropriate sharing pattern(s) and sharing capability(ies) which meet end user needs. Where NRL is the recommended capability, the controller catalogue will be updated to reflect this.

The <a href="https://github.com/nhsconnect/FHIR-NRLS-API/raw/master/content/uploads/NRL%20Authorised%20Organisations%20&%20Actors%20Catalogue.xlsx" >Controller Catalogue</a> is made up of the following sections:

|Section|Description|
|-------|-----------|
| Records & Stakeholders | Lists record types shared on the NRL and stakeholders who are providing, consuming or both providing and consuming the records. |
| Purpose & Lawful Basis | Describes the purpose and lawful basis for the sharing of records with the stakeholders. |
| End User Organisations | Lists the organisations using the NRL and indicates which record types an organisation is providing, consuming or both providing and consuming. |
